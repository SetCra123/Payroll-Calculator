# Payroll-Calculator

## This project is a payroll-calculator, which should collect data and also return data. 


### The application will collect the name of an employee and their salary. The user has a chance to enter as many names and employee salaries as they would like. 


### In this project, I created an object to store employee data, called collectEmployees. I made this object into a method by adding a function that prompts the user to add their information. The data is kept in an array and is nested in a while loop to handle if the user wants to keep adding data.

### In this project, I added a function to calculate the average salary of all employees from the array. The program return the average in the console. 

### Finally, I added a function that will select a random employee and return that data in the console.
